## What is this?

A simple catalogue of the browser MMO games with a lot of focus on being well curated and simple. The list of games is randomized every time the page is loaded, to give all games a fair chance of getting discovered.

## How can I get my game added?

Please submit a pull request with a data file (see the "data/" directory for examples) and a 1200x800 png image.

Remember that the vetting process is pretty rigorous, it's essentially done by [me](https://github.com/Matheus28/) alone, and I prefer games that I find fun, unique and/or interesting.
