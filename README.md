# [m28.studio](https://m28.studio)

## What is this?

A simple catalogue of browser MMO games with a lot of focus on being well curated and simple. The list of games is randomized every time the page is loaded to give all games a fair chance of getting discovered.

## How can I get my game added?

Please submit a pull request with a data file (see the "data/" directory for examples) and a 1200x800 png image.

Remember that the vetting process is pretty rigorous, it's essentially done by [me](https://github.com/Matheus28/) alone, and I prefer games that I find fun, unique and/or interesting.

## Do I need to link back to m28.studio?

Not at all. We provide a small advantage to games that do, making it more likely that they'll be closer to the top of the list. But you're not required to link to the list to be listed.

If you do link back to m28.studio, please prefer naming the link "More games", as the term ".io games" is incredibly non-descriptive.
